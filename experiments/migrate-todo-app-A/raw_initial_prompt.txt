Your job is to create a prompt in markdown and write it to the current working directory with the best name you see for claude code to use in future.  Ask me any clarifying
  questions you need to improve this prompt in a serial nature.  I want you to help me migrate the patternfly 5 application under the "todo-app" application to patternfly 6.
  Patternfly 6 upgrade documentation is located at https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/upgrade.  Your first task is to research how to upgrade to patternfly 6 from 5 and to
  record your research in markdown documents to guide later execution.  Be as thorough as possible in researching migration guidance.  Next inspect the application and consider
  based on what you know what the upgrade steps will be to address to move to patternfly 6.  Develop a migration plan to move to patternfly 6.  Break the plan down into discrete
  units of work that are easily accomplished by an AI agent under 100k tokens per session.  This migration plan is intended to be executed by an ai agent in a subsequent loop.
