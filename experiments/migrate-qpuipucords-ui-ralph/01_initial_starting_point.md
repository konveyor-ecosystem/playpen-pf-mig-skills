Your job is to create a prompt for an AI coding agent to migrate the application at the directory "./quipucords-ui" which uses PatternFly 5 to PatternFly 6.

Your first task is to research how to upgrade to patternfly 6 from 5 and to record your research in markdown documents to guide later execution.  Be as thorough as possible in researching migration guidance.  To begin your research, Patternfly 6 upgrade documentation is located at https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/upgrade. 

Next inspect the application and consider based on what you know what the upgrade steps will be to address to move to patternfly 6.  Develop a migration plan to move to patternfly 6.  Break the plan down into discrete units of work that are easily accomplished by an AI agent under 100k tokens per session.  This migration plan is intended to be executed by an ai agent in a subsequent loop.
    
Write this prompt in markdown to the file: ./02_migrate_quipucords_ui.md
Ask me any clarifying questions you need to improve this prompt in a serial nature.
