## Comparison
Asking claude to do a comparison via: 

"Help me to think through how we can best approach doing a comparison of how well a patternfly 5 to 6 migration proceeded.  I have a PR where I staged changes https://github.com/jwmatthews/quipucords-ui/pull/1 and I
  assume that the "golden" answer for changes I was aiming for is this PR which was completed by a PatternFly expert: https://github.com/quipucords/quipucords-ui/pull/664.   I would like a deep report that analyzes what
   I have in my own fork in the github.com/jwmatthews/quipuicords-ui/pull/1 against the golden truth in pull/664.  Please create a markdown file for the report and write it to disk."
