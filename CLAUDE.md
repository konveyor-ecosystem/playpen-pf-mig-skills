# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is an experimental playpen for prototyping AI agent skills and tools that assist with migrating PatternFly 5 (PF5) codebases to PatternFly 6 (PF6). The focus is exploratory and educational.

## What Belongs Here

- Agent prompts, workflows, and evaluation harnesses
- Scripts and tooling for migration experiments
- Notes and findings from migration trials
- Small, focused proof-of-concepts for automated refactoring

## Guidelines for Contributions

When adding experiments or skills:
- Keep contributions small and focused on a single migration pattern or agent capability
- Include context or notes explaining what was learned
- This is not a production toolchain - prioritize learning over polish
