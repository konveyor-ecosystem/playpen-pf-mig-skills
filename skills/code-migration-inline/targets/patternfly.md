# PatternFly Migration

PatternFly 5 to PatternFly 6 migration with visual regression testing.

## Workflow

```
Pre-Migration → Phase 2 (Fix Loop) → Phase 3 (E2E Tests) → Visual Comparison → Visual Fix → Done
```

## Pre-Migration

Complete BEFORE Phase 2.

### 1. Discover UI Elements

Find every UI element and important state that needs to be captured. **Every navigable route must appear in the manifest. When in doubt, include it. Do not create combinatorial entries — capture each route once in its default state and theme/layout variants only on one representative page.**

**Routes/Pages:**
- Search for router config, route arrays, path definitions, `<Route>` elements
- Check `pages/`, `views/`, `routes/`, `screens/`, `app/` folders
- Find menus, sidebars, navbars, breadcrumbs, footer links and extract all link targets
- Identify parameterized routes and note sample data needed
- Find error pages (404, 500, error boundary)
- **Do not stop after finding the router config.** Cross-reference with navigation components to catch routes that exist in menus but not in the router (and vice versa).
- **Each route gets one manifest entry** in its default state.

**Interactive Components:**
- Modals/Dialogs and their triggers
- Drawers/Sidepanels
- Forms (in modals, pages, or triggered by actions)
- Dropdown menus with distinct visual content (action menus, type selectors)
- Tabs — each tab with visually distinct content is a separate entry
- Wizards/Steppers — each step with distinct UI is a separate entry

**Theme and Layout Variants:**
Check whether the application supports theme switching (light/dark) or layout toggles (sidebar collapsed/expanded). Search for `ThemeProvider`, theme context, `prefers-color-scheme`, `dark`/`light` class toggles, toggle buttons in headers/footers, `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` keys.

- **If themes exist**: pick **one representative page** (the most visually complex) and add a dark-theme variant for that page only.
- **If sidebar collapse exists**: pick **one representative page** and add a collapsed-sidebar variant.
- **Do not multiply every route by every variant.**

**Empty/Error States:**
For pages with data lists or dashboards, add entries only where a visually distinct empty/error UI exists (illustration, call-to-action), not where the page simply shows an empty table.

**Authentication:** Check whether the application requires login. Look for login pages, auth guards, hardcoded credentials in seed files, `.env.example`, test fixtures, or README instructions. Record any credentials needed.

Create `$WORK_DIR/manifest.md`. Each entry must describe exactly what to capture and how to reach the target state:
```markdown
# UI Manifest
Project: <project_path>

## Routes

### / → home.png
- **Navigate to**: root URL (`/`)
- **Wait for**: page content to fully render
- **Key elements**: sidebar navigation, stats cards, data table

### /dashboard → dashboard.png
- **Navigate to**: `/dashboard`
- **Wait for**: all dashboard widgets to load
- **Key elements**: chart area, summary cards, recent activity list

## Interactive Components

### Modal: Confirm Delete → modal-confirm-delete.png
- **Trigger**: on `/dashboard`, click delete button on any table row
- **Wait for**: modal to appear and content to render
- **Key elements**: modal title, confirmation message, Cancel and Confirm buttons

## Theme/Layout Variants

### /dashboard (dark theme) → dashboard--dark.png
- **Navigate to**: `/dashboard`
- **Setup**: activate dark theme via [describe how]
- **Wait for**: theme transition to complete
- **Key elements**: same as dashboard.png but in dark theme

## Empty/Error States

### /dashboard (empty) → dashboard--empty.png
- **Navigate to**: `/dashboard`
- **Setup**: [how to reach empty state]
- **Wait for**: empty state message to render
- **Key elements**: empty state message, call-to-action button
```

**Naming**: `/` → `home.png`, `/dashboard` → `dashboard.png`. Variants: `dashboard--dark.png`, `dashboard--sidebar-collapsed.png`. Components: `modal-<name>.png`, `drawer-<name>.png`, `tabs-<context>-<tab>.png`, `form-<name>.png`. Empty states: `<page>--empty.png`.

### 2. Capture Visual Baseline

1. **Start application and wait** - **The application MUST be running and fully responsive before any `playwright-mcp` interaction.** Playwright operations will fail if the server is not ready. Run dev server **in the background** (append `&` or equivalent) and capture the process ID. Extract the local URL from the server output. **Poll the URL every 2 seconds, up to 120 seconds**, until it returns a successful response. **After the server responds, wait an additional 5 seconds** for JS bundles and assets to fully load. **Do not call any `playwright-mcp` tool until both checks pass.**

2. **Capture screenshots** - For each element in manifest, use `playwright-mcp`:
   - Navigate to page or trigger component (follow any **Setup** steps in the manifest entry)
   - Wait for content to stabilize
   - Take screenshot → save to `$WORK_DIR/baseline/<name>.png`

3. **Verify** - Compare the list of `.png` files in `$WORK_DIR/baseline/` against manifest entries. Every manifest entry must have a corresponding screenshot.

4. **Stop application**

### 3. Run pf-codemods

```bash
npx @patternfly/pf-codemods@latest <project_path> --v6 --fix
```

This auto-fixes many PF5→PF6 issues. Some will still need manual fixes.

### 4. Upgrade Dependencies

Check `package.json` for all `@patternfly/*` dependencies and upgrade every one of them to `^6.x`. This includes packages like `@patternfly/react-core`, `@patternfly/react-table`, `@patternfly/react-icons`, `@patternfly/patternfly`, and any others the project uses. Then run `npm install`.

Verify build passes after upgrade. Address any obvious issues with the build before moving forward.

## During Migration

### Fix Strategy

**Prefer long-term fixes over workarounds.**

Do:

- Use new PF6 APIs and components
- Refactor to match PF6 patterns
- Remove compatibility layers

Avoid:
- Suppressing warnings without fixing
- Using `// @ts-ignore` on deprecated props
- Creating wrappers that preserve old APIs

### Typical Group Order

Adapt based on your findings:

1. **Import paths** - Fix module imports first
2. **Component API changes** - Removed/renamed props
3. **Deprecated API replacements** - Old patterns → new
4. **CSS/Styling** - Class names, design tokens

---

## Post-Migration

**Visual regression testing is required.** Do not skip the visual comparison loop. The migration is incomplete until all visual issues are resolved and every checkbox in the report is checked.

### Visual Regression Loop

Repeat the following loop until no unchecked issues remain. N is the fix round, starting at 0.

**Step 1: Capture screenshots**

Read `$WORK_DIR/manifest.md` (already created during pre-migration).

1. **Start application and wait** - **The application MUST be running and fully responsive before any `playwright-mcp` interaction.** Run dev server **in the background** (append `&`) and capture the process ID. **Poll the URL every 2 seconds, up to 120 seconds.** After the server responds, **wait an additional 5 seconds** for JS bundles and assets. **Do not call any `playwright-mcp` tool until both checks pass.**
2. **Capture screenshots** - For each element in manifest, use `playwright-mcp`:
   - Navigate to page or trigger component
   - Wait for content to stabilize
   - Take screenshot → save to `$WORK_DIR/post-migration-N/<name>.png` (N = fix round, starting at 0)
3. **Stop application**

**Step 2: Compare**

Compare `$WORK_DIR/baseline/` against `$WORK_DIR/post-migration-N/`.

**Ground rules for comparison:**
- **The baseline screenshot is the source of truth.** The post-migration screenshot must look identical to it.
- **Do not rationalize differences.** If something looks different, it IS different. Do not explain away a difference as "expected due to the migration" or "acceptable styling variation." You have no context about what the migration should change visually — your only job is to detect what changed.
- **Report every visible difference**, no matter how small. A 1px shift, a slightly different shade, a font weight change — all are differences and must be reported.
- **When in doubt, report it.** False positives are acceptable. Missed differences are not.

For each element in manifest:
1. **Load both images** (baseline and post-migration)
2. **Describe baseline in detail**: Inventory every visible element — sections, components, text labels, icons, colors, borders, shadows, spacing, alignment, font sizes, background colors, divider lines, badge counts, hover states, scroll positions
3. **Describe post-migration in detail**: Same inventory, independently — do not copy from the baseline description
4. **Diff the two descriptions item by item**: Walk through every element you inventoried and compare. For each, explicitly state whether it is the same or different.

**Scan for these specific difference categories:**

| Category | What to look for |
|----------|-----------------|
| Layout | Position shifts, size changes, reflow, element reordering |
| Spacing | Padding, margins, gaps between elements (even 1-2px) |
| Colors | Background, text, borders, shadows, hover states, opacity |
| Typography | Font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing |
| Borders & dividers | Thickness, style (solid/dashed), color, radius |
| Icons | Different icon, different size, different color, missing |
| Components | Missing, added, or replaced components |
| Text content | Changed labels, truncation, wrapping differences |
| Alignment | Horizontal/vertical alignment shifts |
| Visibility | Elements present in one but hidden/absent in the other |

**You MUST explicitly address EVERY category above for each element.** State "no difference" or describe the difference. Do not skip any.

- List ALL differences found — one bullet per difference, with specific detail (e.g., "Card header padding changed from ~16px to ~12px", not "spacing changed")
- Classify each difference: ⚠️ Minor (styling/spacing/color, does not break functionality) / ❌ Major (missing elements, broken layout, functional breakage)

**Both minor and major issues require fixes.** Do not dismiss minor issues as acceptable.

**Create or update report** - Write `$WORK_DIR/visual-diff-report.md` with checkbox-tracked issues:

```markdown
# Visual Comparison Report

## Issues

### /dashboard
- [ ] Card spacing increased ~4px (⚠️ Minor)
- [ ] Button borders slightly darker (⚠️ Minor)

### /settings
- [ ] Navigation sidebar missing (❌ Major)
```

If the report already exists: mark fixed issues as `[x]`, add new issues as `[ ]`.

**Step 3: Check exit condition**

If all issues in `$WORK_DIR/visual-diff-report.md` are checked (`[x]`) → done, exit loop.

If unchecked (`[ ]`) issues remain → continue to step 4.

**Step 4: Fix**

**Ground rules for fixing:**
- **The baseline screenshot is the source of truth.** The goal is to make post-migration screenshots look identical to baseline. Do not decide that a difference is "acceptable" or "expected."
- **Do not rationalize differences.** If the baseline shows X and the current screenshot shows Y, that is a difference to fix — regardless of whether the migration "should" have changed it.
- **Every reported issue must be fixed.** Do not close an issue as "won't fix" or "by design."
- **Verify fixes against baseline, not against your expectations.** After making a fix, compare the new screenshot to the baseline screenshot — not to what you think it should look like.

Read `$WORK_DIR/status.md` to understand what migration issues have been fixed so far. This helps identify root causes of visual regressions.

Fix unchecked issues by page/route:

1. **Group unchecked issues by page**
2. **For each page with unchecked issues**:
   - Load the baseline screenshot and the current screenshot. Describe what is different — do not assume you already know from the report alone; look at the actual images.
   - Identify cause in code — trace the visual difference to a specific code change (CSS property, component prop, class name, design token, etc.)
   - Make code changes to resolve. The fix must make the current rendering match the baseline.
   - Verify:
     **The application MUST be running and fully responsive before any `playwright-mcp` interaction.**
     - Start app **in the background** (append `&`) and capture the process ID
     - **Poll the URL every 2 seconds, up to 120 seconds.** After the server responds, **wait an additional 5 seconds** for JS bundles and assets. **Do not call any `playwright-mcp` tool until both checks pass.**
     - Use `playwright-mcp` to navigate to the page, take new screenshot
     - Compare the new screenshot against the **baseline** screenshot. Do not compare against the previous post-migration screenshot.
     - Stop the app
   - If the issue persists (new screenshot still differs from baseline), try a different approach. Keep trying until fixed.
   - **First**: append a brief (2-3 line) summary to `$WORK_DIR/visual-fixes.md` describing what was changed and why (or noting the issue was unfixable and why). Write this before any other update so partial progress is preserved if the agent fails midway.
   - Copy the verified screenshot to the post-migration directory: `cp` the screenshot to `$WORK_DIR/post-migration-N/<name>.png`
   - Mark fixed issues as `[x]` in `$WORK_DIR/visual-diff-report.md`
   - Do not wait until all pages are done.

**Fix ALL issues (major AND minor) before completing migration.** Do not dismiss minor issues as acceptable.

Increment N and go back to step 1.
