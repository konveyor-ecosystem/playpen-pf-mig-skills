# Report Generator

Generate a migration report by reading workspace artifacts, building `report-data.json`, and producing an HTML report.

## Inputs

- **Work directory**: workspace root (contains `status.md`, screenshot directories, visual reports)
- **Source technology**: the migration source (e.g., "PatternFly 5")
- **Target technology**: the migration target (e.g., "PatternFly 6")
- **Project path**: path to the project being migrated

## Process

### 1. Read status.md

Read `<work_dir>/status.md` and extract:

- **Complete section**: total rounds, build/test/validation status
- **Groups**: list of groups with their completion status
- **Group Details**: for each group — name, description, files, issues
- **Round Log**: each round's fixed count, new issues, build/test results
- **Action Required section**: items the user must review (unresolved issues, false positives, visual reviews, manual interventions)

### 2. Read Kantra Assessment

Check for the latest Kantra output directory (`<work_dir>/round-*/kantra/output.yaml`). If a final round exists, note any residual incidents (rule, count, reason for keeping).

If no Kantra output exists, set `kantra_residual.total_incidents` to 0.

### 3. Read Visual Comparison Report

If `<work_dir>/visual-diff-report.md` exists, extract per-page results (page name, status, notes). Map unchecked items (`[ ]`) to `fail` status and checked items (`[x]`) to `pass`.

### 4. List Screenshot Directories

Check for `<work_dir>/baseline/` and `<work_dir>/post-migration/` directories. List filenames in each to populate the visual pages array.

If neither directory exists, set `visual.has_screenshots` to `false`.

### 5. Build report-data.json

Create `<work_dir>/report-data.json` using the following schema:

```json
{
  "migration": {
    "source": "string",
    "target": "string",
    "project": "string (project path)",
    "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
    "workspace": "string (workspace path)"
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_rounds": "number",
    "status": "complete|incomplete",
    "build": "PASS|FAIL",
    "unit_tests": "PASS|FAIL|NONE",
    "e2e_tests": "PASS|FAIL|NONE",
    "lint": "PASS|FAIL|NONE",
    "target_validation": "PASS|FAIL|NONE"
  },
  "action_required": [
    {
      "type": "unresolved_issue|false_positive|visual_review|manual_intervention",
      "description": "string",
      "recommendation": "string (optional)",
      "details": "string (optional)",
      "page": "string (optional, for visual_review)"
    }
  ],
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "status": "complete|incomplete",
      "issues_fixed": "number",
      "files": ["string"],
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "rounds": [
    {
      "number": "number",
      "group": "string",
      "issues_fixed": "number",
      "new_issues": "number",
      "build": "PASS|FAIL",
      "tests": "string (e.g. '265/265' or '225/262 (37 snapshot mismatches)')"
    }
  ],
  "visual": {
    "has_screenshots": "boolean",
    "baseline_dir": "string (relative to work_dir)",
    "post_migration_dir": "string (relative to work_dir)",
    "pages": [
      {
        "name": "string",
        "baseline": "string (filename, e.g. 'login.png')",
        "post_migration": "string (filename, e.g. 'login.png')",
        "status": "pass|fail|info",
        "notes": "string"
      }
    ]
  },
  "kantra_residual": {
    "total_incidents": "number",
    "categories": [
      {
        "rule": "string",
        "count": "number",
        "reason": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Field population rules**:

- `migration.source` / `migration.target`: from the source and target technology inputs
- `migration.project`: from the project path input
- `migration.timestamp`: current time in ISO 8601
- `migration.workspace`: the work directory path
- `summary`: from the Complete section of status.md
- `action_required`: from the Action Required section of status.md. Parse each bullet into type, description, and recommendation. If "None", use an empty array.
- `groups`: from Groups and Group Details sections. Mark `[x]` groups as "complete", `[ ]` as "incomplete". Count issues from Group Details. Extract files list.
- `rounds`: from Round Log entries. Parse fixed count, new issues count, build and test results.
- `visual`: from screenshot directories and visual-diff-report.md. If no screenshots exist, set `has_screenshots` to false and omit pages.
- `kantra_residual`: from the latest Kantra output. If 0 residual issues, set `total_incidents` to 0 and `categories` to empty array.

### 6. Read Visual Fixes

If `<work_dir>/visual-fixes.md` exists, read it to understand what visual issues were fixed and how. Use this to verify consistency of `action_required`:

- If a `visual_review` item in `action_required` refers to an issue that is now `[x]` in `visual-diff-report.md`, **remove it** from `action_required` — it was fixed.
- If `visual-diff-report.md` has unchecked (`[ ]`) issues that are **not** represented in `action_required`, **add them** as `visual_review` items.
- If `visual-fixes.md` documents fixes that contradict notes in `action_required` (e.g., an item says "not fixable" but `visual-fixes.md` shows it was fixed), update accordingly.

### 7. Verify Consistency

Before writing `report-data.json`, cross-check the data:

- `summary.status` should be `complete` only if all groups are complete, build passes, and tests pass
- `action_required` should not contain items that are contradicted by other artifacts (e.g., visual issues marked as needing review but already `[x]` in the diff report)
- `visual.pages` status values should match `visual-diff-report.md` — `[x]` → `pass`, `[ ]` → `fail`
- Every screenshot file referenced in `visual.pages` should exist in the baseline and post-migration directories

### 8. Generate HTML Report

Run:
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_migration_report.py <work_dir>
```

## Output

Return the path to the generated `report.html`:

```
Report generated: <work_dir>/report.html
```
