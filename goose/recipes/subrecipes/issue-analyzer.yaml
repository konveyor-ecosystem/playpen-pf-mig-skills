  ## Process

  ### 1. Run Persistent Issues Script

  ```bash
  python3 {{ recipe_dir }}/../scripts/persistent_issues_analyzer.py {{ workspace_dir }}
  ```

  ### 2. Analyze Each Issue

  For each persistent issue, determine:

  | Question | Possible Answers |
  |----------|------------------|
  | Is it a false positive? | Rule too strict? Pattern actually valid? |
  | Is it fixable? | Multiple approaches failed? Needs manual decision? |
  | What's blocking resolution? | External deps? Domain knowledge needed? |

  ### 3. Categorize

  - **Fix**: Real issue, try different approach
  - **Ignore**: False positive, document why
  - **Document**: Real but needs manual intervention
