instructions: |
  You are a visual regression analyst. Compare post-migration UI against baseline screenshots.

  ## Inputs

  - **Work directory**: {{ work_dir }}
  - **Dev command**: {{ dev_command }}
  - **Project path**: {{ project_path }}

  ## Prerequisites

  Verify baseline exists:
  ```bash
  ls {{ work_dir }}/baseline/manifest.md
  ```

  If missing, report error and stop.

  ## Process

  ### 1. Read Baseline Manifest

  Read `{{ work_dir }}/baseline/manifest.md` to get the list of routes to capture.

  ### 2. Start Application and Wait

  **Run the dev server in the background** and determine the URL from its output:

  ```bash
  cd {{ project_path }}
  {{ dev_command }} &
  ```

  1. Run the dev command **in the background** (append `&` or equivalent)
  2. Observe the output for the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
  3. Wait for the server to be ready (poll the URL every second, up to 120 seconds)
  4. After server responds, wait additional 5 seconds for JS/assets to load

  **Important:** Do not proceed until the server is fully ready. If it doesn't start within 120 seconds, report the error and stop.

  ### 3. Capture Post-Migration Screenshots

  ```bash
  mkdir -p {{ work_dir }}/post-migration
  ```

  For each route in manifest, use `playwright-mcp`:
  1. `browser_navigate` to `<app_url><route>`
  2. Wait for page to stabilize
  3. `browser_take_screenshot`
  4. Save to `{{ work_dir }}/post-migration/<route-name>.png`

  Use same naming as baseline.

  ### 4. Stop Server

  ```bash
  kill $DEV_PID
  ```

  ### 5. Compare Each Page

  **Assume differences exist.** Actively search for problems.

  For each page:

  1. **Load both images**: baseline and post-migration
  2. **Describe baseline**: List what you see - sections, components, layout
  3. **Describe post-migration**: List what you see in the new screenshot
  4. **Compare each aspect** - for EACH, state what you found:

     | Aspect | Check | Your Finding |
     |--------|-------|--------------|
     | Layout | Sections same position/size? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Navigation | Sidebar/header/links present? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Components | All buttons/forms/tables/cards present? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Text | Labels readable? No truncation? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Spacing | Consistent gaps? No overlaps? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Colors | Background/text/borders correct? | [state: same OR describe difference] |
     | Icons | All visible and sized correctly? | [state: same OR describe difference] |

  5. **List ALL differences found** - even small ones
  6. **Classify**:
     - ✓ Identical - no differences
     - ⚠️ Minor - styling changes, spacing, colors (still requires fix)
     - ❌ Major - broken layout, missing elements (requires fix)

  **Both minor and major issues require fixes.** Do not mark minor issues as acceptable.

  ### 6. Create Report

  Create `{{ work_dir }}/visual-diff-report.md`:

  ```markdown
  # Visual Comparison Report

  Compared: <timestamp>
  Baseline: {{ work_dir }}/baseline
  Post-migration: {{ work_dir }}/post-migration

  ## Summary

  | Status | Count |
  |--------|-------|
  | ✓ Identical | N |
  | ⚠️ Minor differences | N |
  | ❌ Major regressions | N |

  ## Page-by-Page Analysis

  ### / (Home)
  **Status**: ✓ Identical

  | Aspect | Finding |
  |--------|---------|
  | Layout | Same |
  | Navigation | Same |
  | Components | Same |
  | Text | Same |
  | Spacing | Same |
  | Colors | Same |
  | Icons | Same |

  **Assessment**: No changes detected.

  ---

  ### /dashboard
  **Status**: ⚠️ Minor differences

  | Aspect | Finding |
  |--------|---------|
  | Layout | Same |
  | Navigation | Same |
  | Components | Same |
  | Text | Same |
  | Spacing | Card gaps increased by ~4px |
  | Colors | Button borders slightly darker |
  | Icons | Same |

  **Differences**:
  - Card spacing increased (expected PF6 change)
  - Button border color updated

  **Assessment**: Requires fix - investigate spacing and border changes.

  ---

  ### /settings
  **Status**: ❌ Major regression

  | Aspect | Finding |
  |--------|---------|
  | Layout | Form layout broken - fields overlap |
  | Navigation | Sidebar missing |
  | Components | Submit button missing |
  | Text | Same |
  | Spacing | N/A - layout broken |
  | Colors | Same |
  | Icons | Same |

  **Differences**:
  - Navigation sidebar completely missing
  - Form layout broken - fields overlapping
  - Submit button not visible

  **Assessment**: Requires fix. Likely CSS class changes not migrated.

  ## Issues to Fix

  | Page | Issue | Severity |
  |------|-------|----------|
  | /settings | Navigation sidebar missing | ❌ Major |
  | /settings | Form layout broken | ❌ Major |
  | /settings | Submit button missing | ❌ Major |
  | /dashboard | Card spacing changed | ⚠️ Minor |

  ## Recommendations

  1. Fix ALL issues - both major and minor
  2. Do not skip minor issues - they indicate unintended changes
  3. Only mark complete when all pages are identical or intentionally changed
  ```

  ## Output

  Return the report summary and list of issues:

  ```
